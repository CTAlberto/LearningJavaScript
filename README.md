About
I have just completed my first year of learning Java, and I am currently studying Advanced Vocational Training in Web Development.
During these holidays, my goal is to develop a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application.
I will be documenting my progress and sharing updates on this project.
